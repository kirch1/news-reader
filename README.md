# News Reader

News Reader is a responsive React application use to view articles from [News API](https://newsapi.org/). This project is a take home challenge, with a time frame of no more than 8 hours to completion. Users can select from a list of news catergories and the day they want to see new from. The user can then select from a list of articles to view more details, or visit the original news post.

- A “detailed” view for each article (headline, image, date, content, source)
- Articles in the list must link to a detailed article view within your app (linking to the source website does not fulfill this requirement)
